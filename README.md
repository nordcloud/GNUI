# General Nordcloud UI

This repo contains Nordcloud PAT Design System - a collection of reusable react components that can be used in PAT products.

## Components

1. Design System (`/components`)
2. Storybook (`/stories`)

## Usage

[WIP] Install github package.

## Storybook deployment

Storybook allows you to preview GNUI components. It deploys automatically using Amplify Console, triggered by changes on branch `master`. Pipeline steps can be found in `amplify.yml`.

When you create PR against `master` branch, Amplify will create new deployment automatically - the environment will be attached to PR at Github. Reviewers can preview changes using this deployment - after the PR gets merged or rejected, the environment is destroyed automatically by Amplify Console.

## Contributing to this repo

- Please create your components in `src/components` and update stories in `stores`.
- Code should be formatted using [Prettier](https://prettier.io/).
- We are using styled-components for styling.
- All code should be written using TS.
- Every component props should be described using interface.

## Local setup
